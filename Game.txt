Casino Project

This branch is to be about a project that incoporates different
casion games into one program as if it were a real Casino

#1 Rollio

Two six sided die are rolled five times
A random number score is genrated between 25-50
The sum of all the die will determine whether you beat that score or didn't
Prize money: TBD

**This is the first of many casino projects to be added. I am also planning to incorporate feature like money and whatever else I can think of**
**Btw i've made Rollio already, its just that i forgot to save it -_-**
